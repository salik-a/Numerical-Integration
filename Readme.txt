 This program developed for find the numerical integration with midpoint and trapezoid composite quadrature rules. The answers are depends on your k value that you enter in program. The equations that you can find the integration this program :
	
1-4/(1+x^2)        
2-x^(1/2)*log(x)   

	
 After compiling and run the program wants to a,b,k values from you and wants to choose which function do you want to solve. Then you will see the solutions according to the midpoint and trapezoid rules.
